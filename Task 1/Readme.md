# Movie Genre Classification

## Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model that predicts the genre of a movie based on its plot summary. The project utilizes natural language processing techniques to transform textual data into numerical features, which are then used to train various classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines.

## Features

- **Data Collection and Preparation**: Load and preprocess movie plot summaries.
- **Feature Extraction**: Transform text data using TF-IDF or word embeddings.
- **Model Training**: Train classifiers and tune them for optimal performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, but recommended for step-by-step execution)
- Git
